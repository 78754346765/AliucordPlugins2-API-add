# TextFilePreview - [Download](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/blob/builds/TextFilePreview.zip?raw=true)

Adds previews to text file embeds. By default, loads the first 1000 bytes. If the file is larger than that, it is possible to load the rest by
clicking the embed. This is limited to 500kb since anything else would freeze the App.

I plan to make preview size configurable in the future, but for now it is fixed to 1000 bytes.
