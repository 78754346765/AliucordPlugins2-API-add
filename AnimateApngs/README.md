# AnimateApngs - [Download](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/blob/builds/AnimateApngs.zip?raw=true)

Simple plugin that makes apngs animate just like gifs

## Limitations

Only attachments and embeds of cdn.discordapp.com or media.discordapp.net links will be animated. Discord's proxy server does not serve apngs,
so to correctly animate proxied images the proxy would have to be stripped which would expose your IP to the image host.
