# ShowBlockedMessages

Makes it so that messages of blocked users show up just like regular messages (without the 1 blocked message stuff).

Probably not too useful to most people, I just made it so that i can block people who dm me annoying stuff / ping spam while still 
being able to talk to them on servers.
